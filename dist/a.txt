Hello world .........  

Welcome to your new state of the art of touch switches for homes

These will all be  touch screen interfaces  operable across the net 

The reasons for this are  as follows

1: Isolation from mains  No real danger

2: No moving parts, no arcing of contacts

3: Can be used with low voltage led lighting

4: Can be menu driven 

5: Cheaper, more robust 

6: Can also provide you mood light settings

7: Dimming 

8: Control any selection of lights in conjunction with sensing 

9: Can be timer operated and can be linked into networks 

This is the way lighting  will transform in the near future  

Thanks for watching 

Mark Harrington  

I will place code to do this in slow motion @ github
